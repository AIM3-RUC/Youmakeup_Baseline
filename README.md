## Step Ordering Baseline
We prepared two kinds of baseline for this task. 

One is Text-only Ordering, to reproduce it, please refer to [./step_ordering/Pairwise ](https://github.com/AIM3-RUC/Youmakeup_Baseline/tree/master/step_ordering/Pairwise).

The other is Video-aware Text Ordering, to reproduce it, please refer to [./step_ordering/SCDM_based](https://github.com/AIM3-RUC/Youmakeup_Baseline/tree/master/step_ordering/SCDM_based).
